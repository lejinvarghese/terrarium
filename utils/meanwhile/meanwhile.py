"""meanwhile — horizontal matrix rain of things happening right now.

A full wall of code sweeps across the terminal like cmatrix turned on its
side. Out of the noise, real things decode into view: live science headlines
(via the Tavily API) in white — clickable in terminals that support hyperlinks —
local intel for a place you tune to in red, and true, quietly poetic facts
about what is happening somewhere on Earth right now in amber.

No Tavily key? Headlines fall back to public RSS feeds (science-focused).

stdlib only. Run: meanwhile
